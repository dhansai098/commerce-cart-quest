-- Orders are private - no public SELECT access

-- But this demo doesn't have user authentication

-- Fix cart table: Improve session validation
-- Remove the overly permissive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cart items accessible by session" ON public.cart;

-- Create separate policies for each operation with session validation
-- Note: This is a basic implementation. For production, use proper authentication.
